                        <p class=" text-center">Every person has a story to tell but not everyone realises if their story is going to get an audience large enough or if their story is worth listening to . My name is Dhiraj Kumar Raut, I am a second year student at SRM UNIVERSITY in Andhra Pradesh , and this is my story. The story of a lost, under-confident kid from a small country Nepal who went to attend his college in Andhra Pradesh unaware of the world around functions to leaving the college as a humble, curious and confident person who wanted to create his own path to a world that he operated , on his terms.</p>

            <p class=" text-center">I came to Andhra Pradesh as a 18 year old kid from small city Birgunj, a small town in Nepal.After searching for the list of best engineering colleges in India numerous times, my father decided upon SRMAP. After joining the campus during lockdown period,I started my First semester classes in online mode and completed my first semester in online. In Half of the second semester college decided to conduct hybrid classes.That time I was confused either to go to campus or not.That time in my mind two things are coming First-If I would go,then I have to pay hostel fee which is too costly ,Second-If I would not go,then i can't get practical knowledge which maybe impact on future.Then after all I started talking with my friends which are from Nepal.Oneday we conducted a meeting ,after too many discussions me and my friends decided to go for the offline mode.</p><br>

                <p>When I entered the hostel and saw my room, I was horrified, a room where 2 beds. A hospital bed lookalike was allotted to me as well and there was one other room mate , his name is pradip and he is also from Nepal.We didn't like the room.We started complaining the IR office.My roomate directly threatened the Dr. Sweta Pasupalithi(Director of IR) by writing the mail to Dean.After that they changed our beds and replace every dirty things to new one.

                    I had earlier heard a lot of negativity about mess food and was very worried about it as well, when I tasted Set dosa for the first time, I felt that mess food is not that bad. It is just that when you get habituated to one kind of food , you get bored of it. My friend's mother who came with him to see our college gave me an important advice after tasting the food, she told the food that does not taste great is usually very healthy . It was a great day, got an opportunity to meet lot of new people, people who came from various parts of the country. The next day was our first class, all excited I went to class, it didnâ€™t take me long to understand that there was a huge diversity of students, in terms of culture, in terms of financial background, and definitely in terms of interest towards engineering.
                    
                    We met a few seniors, gave introductions, got to understand how to make fun of each other and how to defend ourselves, some of the important learnings of engineering came from these introductions. Exams were always a special part, completing a syllabus taught for 4 months in a single night was something we considered ourselves proud of . Earlier everyone used to be worried about the marks and GPA, but with time we understood that GPA was just an eligibility barrier for placements and higher education and was its role was restricted to these two only.

                <p class="my-2">This day(International Day) was a memorable day of my life.On the ocassion of International day our IR office decided to conduct the program.For discussion, they conduct a meeting and in meeting they said that everyone have to participate compulsorily and I was worried because I didn't know the dance nor singing(I was just a bathroom singer).I decided to perform Ramp walk which is easy and for that I started searching to make group to perform it for tha I started conviencing my friends but they were feeling shy that time but after my convincing they became ready and we formed a group of 4 girls and 6 boys.We went to stage and confidiently rock on stage with the swag called PARA in nepali language.</p>
